## Authors: Angela Cheng, Crystal Diaz, Janet Pham, Laurand Osmeni

## Introduction
_Why was the project undertaken?_

Our team undertook this project to address the need for data science and visualization techniques in improving diabetes detection and prediction by leveraging data science and visualization techniques. According to  American Diabetes Association approximately 37.3 million Americans affected by diabetes, which accounts for 11.3% of the population, and around 1.9 million individuals living with type 1 diabetes, including about 244,000 children and adolescents, the significance of effective disease management cannot be overstated. By providing valuable insights through analytical methods and visualizations, our goal was to empower healthcare professionals to improve outcomes for individuals affected by diabetes. 



_What was the research question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the research?_

Our research question is, how accurate is using machine learning, data science, and visualization techniques to predict the early detection of diabetes? 
We hypothesized that there is a way to apply machine learning and tools to predict and detect for early signs of diabetes.

## Selection of Data
_What is the source of the dataset? Characteristics of data?_
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00529/diabetes_data_upload.csv
Dataset Description: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.
Characteristics of data: 
The dataset consists of 520 instances representing newly diagnosed diabetic individuals. There are 17 attributes describing signs and symptoms related to diabetes. The dataset is specifically designed for early stage diabetes risk prediction. Is obtained from the UCI website, which is a reliable and respected source for machine learning datasets. However, our team is unable to independently verify the accuracy of the dataset and its attribute information. 


_Any munging or feature engineering?_
Yes, to prepare the dataset for analysis, we performed data cleaning and feature engineering. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and fixing inconsistencies. We also created new features and transformed existing ones to better capture relevant information. These steps improved the quality and usefulness of the data for our analysis.

## Methods
_What materials/APIs/tools were used or who was included in answering the research question?_
Methods and materials we used for data analysis libraries were Pandas and NumPy, along with machine learning libraries as scikit-learn, for building and training predictive models. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to present the findings and visualize the data.

Collaborative platforms such as Slack, GitHub, Colab, and Jupyter Notebook were employed to facilitate communication among team members and share code. Everyone on the team participated in answering the research question, providing input, suggestions, and making improvements to the project.

Also, we searched and looked at the valuable insights from healthcare professionals through the clinician professional website, https://diabetes.org. Their expertise helped us gain domain specific knowledge on aspects related to diabetes detection and management.

## Results
_What answer was found to the research question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true? Any visualizations?_
Our study found that data science and visualization techniques effectively support the early detection and prediction of diabetes. Key factors such as age, gender, and symptoms like polyuria and polydipsia were identified as significant predictors of diabetes. Visualizations including bar plots, violin plots, scatter plots, and confusion matrices provided valuable insights into the distribution of diabetes cases and the performance of predictive models.

Yes, the tested hypothesis were true. The hypothesis that data science and visualization techniques can support the early detection and prediction of diabetes was supported by the study's findings.

The study utilized various visualizations, such as bar plots, violin plots, scatter plots, and confusion matrices, to enhance understanding of patterns, correlations, and predictive models in diabetes detection and prediction.


## Discussion
_What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are the perspectives for future research? Survey about the tools investigated for this assignment._
The implications of the findings suggest that age, gender, and specific symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia play important roles in predicting the likelihood of developing diabetes. Understanding these factors can help healthcare professionals identify individuals at higher risk and implement preventive measures or early interventions.

The research on diabetes risk factors, age is a well established factor, with older individuals being more susceptible to developing diabetes. Gender differences in diabetes prevalence have also been documented, with some studies indicating a higher risk for males. Also, symptoms like polyuria and polydipsia are recognized as common early signs of diabetes.

The future research perspectives could focus on exploring the interplay between different risk factors and their impact on diabetes prediction. Investigating additional variables, lifestyle factors, and genetic markers, could enhance the accuracy of predictive models.

The tools investigated in this assignment, they encompassed various analytical techniques commonly used in data exploration and machine learning. These tools included data visualization techniques of histograms, box plots, scatter plots, graphviz etc.. correlation analysis, classification algorithms Decision Tree, and evaluation metrics of accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve.


## Summary
The study found that age, gender, and specific symptoms such as frequent urination and increased thirst are important factors in the early detection and prediction of diabetes. Visualizations, including bar plots, violin plots, and scatter plots, were used to illustrate the distribution of diabetes cases and correlations between variables. These findings highlight the value of data science and visualization techniques in helping the understanding and management of diabetes.
