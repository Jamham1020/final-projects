Explain what happens when you run the threadSync.c program? 
After running the threadSync.c program, it shows at the rate of sleep(1) how one thread
enter it's critical section and when it returns. In total there are 10 threads starting
from thread 0 to thread 9. After thread 9 is returned, the program will finish and the 
statement, "Main thread done" will appear. Some of the threads are not in numerical order
and enters its critical section and return in random orders. After running it again it the results are
exactly the same on the mlc104 server, but when I run it different times on my vm it;s different.
