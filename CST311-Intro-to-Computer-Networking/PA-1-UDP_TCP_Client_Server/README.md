# PA 1 - UDP-TCP-Client-Server

## Instructions: 

In this assignment, you will learn the basics of socket programming for UDP and TCP in Python. 

You will learn how to send and receive datagram packets using UDP sockets and TCP sockets. Throughout the assignment, you will gain familiarity with a Client Server architecture.  You will use Python 3 for your programming language.

This assignment basically requires you to submit the Python client and server code for the UDP socket programming example in Section 2.7.1 and then also the TCP socket programming example in Section 2.7.2. (Note that these examples are written in Python 2.  You will have to modify a few lines of code to convert to Python 3.)  You should each try to do this on your own first but you will then work with your assigned team for this assignment. Split up your team to have one group do the UDP example together and another group to do the TCP example. The goal of this assignment is a) to learn about how UDP and TCP works and how to program with UDP and TCP and also b) to make sure your computer is set up and working, ready for the next assignment where you will be writing your own code. You are welcome to use whatever IDE the team prefers; for this assignment with about 10 lines of code, you may prefer to simply use an editor but this is up to you. Code it, test it with the following cases:  

```
abcdef abc123def  

ABcdEF  

AB12cdEF  

Two Words HERE !!  
```

## Grading Objectives 
For TCP and for UDP each: (30 + 30 = 60 points)

(5 points) Socket set up correctly on server 

(5 points) Socket set up correctly on client 

(5 points) Server waits for input 

(5 points) Client sends message to server

(5 points) Server takes input and changes it to all CAPS

(5 points) Client receives and prints out the modified message.
