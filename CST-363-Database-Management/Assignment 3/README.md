# Assignment 3

A common database design when dealing with multiple products that have different properties (such as printers have color, laser, and pages per minutes properties) while laptops have properties such as speed, memory, HDD size is to have a single table for all products and models and then individual tables that give details of each product type.

This design is used in this assignment. 

Create a product database using the script file assignment_2a_schema.sql

Then answer the questions in assignment 2a.sql and submit your updated sql file.
