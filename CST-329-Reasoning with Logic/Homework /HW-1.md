# HW 1 Reading #1

1. Write an English sentence that is not a declarative sentence.

       A declarative sentence is one that is true or false.
       Please, open the door.

2. Which of the following sentences are declarative?

       ** A. Beer sales are up 16% so far this year **
       B. When will all the activities be in-person again?
       C. To become a better listener, stay present with each word as it is spoken to you

3. Which of the following sentences have clear truth value?

        A. Alicia is kind of smart 
        ** B. Hydrogen is a molecule ** 
        ** C. Taft was the 15th US president **

 4. Which of the following declarative sentences are atomic?

        ** A. There are four quarters in a dollar. **
        B. Both Bush and Clinton were president in 1993.
        C. If Alex goes to the party then Sam will, too.

5. Does the following sentence have proper syntax?

   "I own throw green spaghetti"

         ** Yes **
         No
         The sentence has bad syntax, because two verbs appear next to each other (own and throw). Two verbs can show up next to each other in some cases, but not two simple present tense transitive verbs like these ones, so the sentence structure is poor.

7. Is the following a statement about syntax or semantics?

   "Write the number in decimal form."

       A. semantics
       ** B. syntax **

1. Write a translation key for the following sentence:

"I will get a taco if I go to Jack-in-the-Box".

Use as many lines in the response template as needed.

    Translation Key: 

    P: I go to Jack-in-the-box

    Q: I will get a taco

    The statement can be re-read as, If I go to Jack-in-the-box, then I will get a taco.

    So, the logic statement for this if…then.. statement is P -> Q.

2. Write a translation key for the following sentence

"x + 1 is not a negative number whenever x is a negative number"

Use as many lines of the response template as you need.

    P: x + 1 is a negative number

    Q: x is a negative number

    Also acceptable:

    P: x + 1 is a positive number

    Q: x is a positive number

    atomic sentences may not contain negations. To write this in a proper form, you must use your second choice of translation key.

3. Translate the following phrase into our logical language:

if P then Q

    P → Q 
    P → Q 
    (P → Q) 
    (P → Q) 

4. Translate the following phrase into our logical language:

   P so long as Q

       Q → P

5. If P is false, and Q is false, then what is the truth value of the following logical sentence?

   P → Q

       False
       ** True **, Sentence P → Q is true if P is false, no matter what the value of Q is.

6. If P is true and Q is false then what is the truth value of P → Q ?

       True
       ** False **, this is the only situation in which P → Q is false.

7. "If Seaside High School is 5000 feet above sea level, then the CSUMB campus is 10000 feet above sea level". 

    The city of Seaside is only 33 feet above sea level, and definitely doesn't reach 5000 ft.

    Using our definition of implication, is this sentence true or false?

       False
       ** True ** an implication is true whenever the premise is false.

8. If P is true and Q is false, do these two formulas have the same truth values?

   ¬(P → Q)

   P → ¬Q

       No
       ** Yes ** Both sentences are true

9. If the truth value of "P" is false, then what is the truth value of ¬¬P?

       ** False **
       True

10. If "P" stands for the atomic sentence "Sal and Evelyn are friends", then write a sentence in our logical language for

"Sal and Evelyn are not friends"

    ¬P

11. Write a logical sentence for

    "If Sal is friends with Eddy then Sal is not friends with Evelyn."

    using the following translation key:

    P: "Sal and Evelyn are friends"

    Q:  "Sal and Eddy are friends"

        (Q → ¬(P)) 
        Q → ¬ P 
        Q → ¬(P) 
        Q → ¬P
    
12. Write a logical sentence for

    "if the bank door is closed then the bank is not being robbed"

    using the following translation key:

    P: "the bank is being robbed"

    Q:  "the bank door is open"

        (¬Q) → (¬P) 
        ¬Q → ¬P 
        ((¬Q) → (¬P))

13. P, Q, and R are atomic sentences.  Write a logical sentence that captures

    "if P, then Q implies R"

        P → (Q → R) 
        (P → (Q → R)) 
        P → (Q → R)
