# Practice Problems (Week 3)

## Conditional Derivation

1. Write a proof using proof-checker to show that this argument is valid:
   ```
   P
   ______
   Q → P
   ```
   Hints: with this and many of these problems, our subproof can be thought of as saying “suppose something is true, what happens?”
          you will need to use the 'repeat' rule within your subproof

   PROOF:
   ```
   Construct a proof for the argument: P ∴ Q → P
   1 P
   2 | Q
   3 | P	         1 Repeat (Rep)
   4 Q → P	      2–3 Conditional derivation(->I)
