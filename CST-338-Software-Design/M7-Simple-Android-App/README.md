# Simple Android App

## Understand the Problem

We are now finished with our team activities.  This will be an individual assignment.  Each person in the class should turn in a different solution.

In order to use Android Studio, we need to install it and get help with the tools.  There is a good series of videos on YouTube that I linked to in the learning section above.

You watched the first several videos in a series and they showed you how to get the phone emulator running and then how to create a custom AVD.

You learned how to place widgets on the display in the MainActivity screen then how to get a button to respond to launch new activities.

 

 

## Phase 1: Design and create a simple Android App
1. This is the only phase for this module (yea!)

2. Watch the videos and create all that they do.

3. Create a Listview that has each of the classes in the list that must be completed in the [CSUMB CSIT online degree](https://catalog.csumb.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=1&poid=218) Use the number and name, according to the sequence you will take them. (ie. CST 338 - Software Design) When you click each item, it will show the course description for that courseLinks to an external site..

4. Create a button on the home screen that will launch a new activity and show this videoLinks to an external site..

5. Include the CSUMB icon in the app.  Find it on the csumb.edu page

6. Change the background color and the color of the text.

7. Include a separate zip file with screenshots of your AVD running.  There should be a minimum of 4 screenshots:
    1. when you first open the app,
    2. showing the video
    3. and two different course descriptions.

8. Be sure to tell me (in the assignment submission box below) what the requirements are for me to run it in terms of the custom AVD.

### Submission
- Two files.
- First, zip up the folder that was created from the Android App and submit it.
- Second, a zip of the screenshots. 
- This is an individual assignment.
