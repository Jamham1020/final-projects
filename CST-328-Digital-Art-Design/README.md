# Design a Game Menu (Week 2)
Design a game menu. Due before the next Module opens. Start by:

Locate an EXISTING game menu still. It can be from any game.

Now, identify the pieces of the menu you MUST HAVE for it to function (all non-decorative elements, ie, clickable elements and important text)

Re-make the menu in a brand new style, including your own design choices and decorative elements. Don't copy everything about the original menu- make a brand new one, start over from scratch. Perhaps you want to apply a genre shift to the menu (Pokemon team menu, but grimdark and edgy) change the setting around (Mass Effect menu, but fantasy instead of sci-fi) or apply a novel design choice (converting rectangular menus to circles or another unusual shape) .

Clarify WHY you made the changes you did.

# Interactive User Interface Prototype - japham-4.zip (Week 4)

## Creating Interactive User Interface Prototype

Watch the two video tutorials of this week and use Adobe XD to create an interactive prototype of the user interface (app, website, software, control panel...) you designed through the previous assignment (Module 4), or create a new design if you are not quite happy with it. 

Artwork specifications: 

- In Adobe XD, use the same display size you used for the UI design you created in Module 4 (web 1280x1024, 1920x1080, mobile, tablet...). 
- Create an interactive prototype with at least five screens/pages of the interface you designed in module 4. Create additional screens (i.e. splash screen, gallery, contact form, sign in, product specs, cart...) following the visual style.
- The prototype should exhibit the following interactive features:
    1. Scrolling Page/s
    2. Scrolling Groups
    3. Component States (i.e. Hovering)
    4. Repeat Grid
    5. Animation (Optional)
- Color space: all images, graphics, and artwork should be in RGB.
- Use layers and groups with appropriate labels to organize the digital file/s (specifically for Illustrator and Photoshop files).

### Objectives: 

- Apply UI design fundamentals to create a pleasant and functional user interface design.
- Develop an interactive prototype using Adobe XD and Illustrator/Photoshop as needed to mimic the navigational flow and animations to the app/website.
- Construct digital files with proper specifications to fulfill the task requirements.
- Create aesthetically pleasing visual and interactive designs that clearly communicate the design purposes and functionalities.
- Establish professional habits for managing, organizing, and formatting digital graphic files. 

# Final Project Design Iterations, Interactive Prototyping, and Presentation (Final Project.zip) (Week 7-8)

## Presentation and Design Process Documentation

Watch the videos of this module and apply the knowledge and software skills you gained through the course to apply and design the following:

- Revise and refine the prototype as needed in response to the feedback you get from your classmates, 
- Develop a project documentation presentation (simple and minimalistic layout. The focus should be your creative design work),
- Video presentation of the app.

## Requirements and Specifications: 

- Project documentation (Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint, or a PDF) file includes:
  - Summary defining the purpose and scope of the app,
  - Sketches and/or notes (optional),
  - Graphic elements and assets (i.e. color palette, logo/icons, typography, imagery),
  - Lo-fi Wireframes (all designs),
  - Hi-fi interface design (all designs),
  - A link to the XD prototype.
 
 ### Objectives: 

- Apply design fundamentals and software knowledge to create a minimalistic, yet pleasant presentation layout.
- Develop concise documentation of the project, tracing the design process journey. 
- Create and implement a video presentation of the project utilizing communication, management, and software skills.
- Construct digital files following the required specifications guidelines.
- Critique and provide feedback to others using the appropriate terminologies and rationale.
